katdal
======

This package serves as a data access library to the HDF5 files produced by
the Fringe Finder, KAT-7 and MeerKAT data capturing systems. It uses memory
carefully, allowing files to be inspected and partially loaded into memory.
Data sets may be concatenated and split via a flexible selection mechanism.
In addition, it provides a script to convert these HDF5 files to CASA
MeasurementSets.

Quick Tutorial
--------------

Open any HDF5 file through a single function to obtain a data set object:

.. code:: python

  import katdal
  d = katdal.open('1234567890.h5')

This automatically determines whether it is a version 1 (FF), version 2
(KAT-7) or version 3 (MeerKAT) file. Multiple files (even of different
versions) may also be concatenated together (as long as they have the
same dump rate):

.. code:: python

  d = katdal.open(['1234567890.h5', '1234567891.h5'])

Inspect the contents of the file by printing the object:

.. code:: python

  print d

Here is a typical output::

The first segment of the printout displays the static information of the data
set, including observer, dump rate and all the available subarrays and spectral
windows in the data set. The second segment (between the dashed lines) highlights
the active selection criteria. The last segment displays dynamic information
that is influenced by the selection, including the overall visibility array
shape, antennas, channel frequencies, targets and scan info.

The data set is built around the concept of a three-dimensional visibility array
with dimensions of time, frequency and correlation product. This is reflected in
the *shape* of the dataset:

.. code:: python

  d.shape

which returns ``(1054, 1024, 112)``, meaning 1054 dumps by 1024 channels by 112
correlation products.

Let's select a subset of the data set:

.. code:: python

  d.select(scans='track', channels=slice(200,300), ants='ant4')
  print d

This results in the following printout::

Compared to the first printout, the static information has remained the same
while the dynamic information now reflects the selected subset. There are many
possible selection criteria, as illustrated below:

.. code:: python

  d.select(timerange=('2011-08-11 13:10:00', '2011-08-11 13:15:00'), targets=[1, 2])
  d.select(spw=0, subarray=0)
  d.select(ants='ant1,ant2', pol='H', scans=(0,1,2), freqrange=(1700e6, 1800e6))

See the docstring of ``DataSet.select`` for more detailed information (i.e.
do ``d.select?`` in IPython). Take note that only one subarray and one spectral
window must be selected.

Once a subset of the data has been selected, you can access the data and
timestamps on the data set object:

.. code:: python

  vis = d.vis[:]
  timestamps = d.timestamps[:]

Note the ``[:]`` indexing, as the ``vis`` and ``timestamps`` properties are
special ``LazyIndexer`` objects that only give you the actual data when
you use indexing, in order not to inadvertently load the entire array into memory.

For the example dataset and no selection the ``vis`` array will have a shape of
``(1054, 1024, 112)``. The time dimension is labelled by ``d.timestamps``, the
frequency dimension by ``d.channel_freqs`` and the correlation product dimension
by ``d.corr_products``.

Another key concept in the data set object is that of *sensors*. These are named
time series of arbritrary data that are either loaded from the file (*actual*
sensors) or calculated on the fly (*virtual* sensors). Both variants are
accessed through the *sensor cache* (available as ``d.sensor``) and cached there
after the first access. The data set object also provides convenient properties
to expose commonly-used sensors, as shown in the plot example below:

.. code:: python

  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.plot(d.az, d.el, 'o')
  plt.xlabel('Azimuth (degrees)')
  plt.ylabel('Elevation (degrees)')

Other useful attributes include ``ra``, ``dec``, ``lst``, ``mjd``, ``u``,
``v``, ``w``, ``target_x`` and ``target_y``. These are all one-dimensional
NumPy arrays that dynamically change length depending on the active selection.

As in katdal's predecessor (scape) there is a ``DataSet.scans`` generator
that allows you to step through the scans in the data set. It returns the
scan index, scan state and target object on each iteration, and updates
the active selection on the data set to include only the current scan.
It is also possible to iterate through the compound scans with the
``DataSet.compscans`` generator, which yields the compound scan index, label
and first target on each iteration for convenience. These two iterators may also
be used together to traverse the data set structure:

.. code:: python

  for compscan, label, target in d.compscans():
      plt.figure()
      for scan, state, target in d.scans():
          if state in ('scan', 'track'):
              plt.plot(d.ra, d.dec, 'o')
      plt.xlabel('Right ascension (J2000 degrees)')
      plt.ylabel('Declination (J2000 degrees)')
      plt.title(target.name)

Finally, all the targets (or fields) in the data set are stored in a catalogue
available at ``d.catalogue``, and the original HDF5 file is still accessible via
a back door installed at ``d.file`` in the case of a single-file data set.
